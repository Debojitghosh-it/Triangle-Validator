# Triangle-Validator
📐 Triangle Validator & ClassifierA simple, robust Java console application that validates whether three given angles can form a triangle and then classifies the triangle type. 🚀🌟 OverviewThis project takes user input for three angles and performs two levels of checks:Validation: Ensures the sum of angles is exactly 180° and all angles are positive.Classification: Identifies if the triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.Getty Images🛠️ Features✅ Input Validation: Checks if the sum equals 180°.✅ Edge Case Handling: Prevents zero or negative angles from being valid.✅ Smart Classification: * Equilateral: All three angles are equal ($60^{\circ}$ each).Isosceles: At least two angles are equal.Scalene: No angles are equal.🧹 Resource Management: Properly closes the Scanner to prevent memory leaks.
